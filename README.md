üß© Algorithm Practice Exercises

Welcome to my repository for practicing algorithms! Here, I‚Äôll be uploading exercises to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of algorithms, and explore different techniques.

‚Ä¢ Exercises are written in TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
‚Ä¢ TypeScript: The primary language for implementing the algorithms.
‚Ä¢ Jest: For validating the implementations.

üöÄ How to Use:

    1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DamianIanni/Typescript-Algorithms.git

    3.	Install dependencies to use Jest:

npm install

    4.	Run an example:

npm run getMiddle

‚ú® Goals
‚Ä¢ Gain deeper insights into core algorithmic concepts.
‚Ä¢ Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
‚Ä¢ Experiment with different problem-solving strategies.

Feel free to fork the repository, contribute, or suggest improvements!
