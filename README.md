üß© Algorithm Practice Exercises

Welcome to my repository for practicing algorithms! Here, I‚Äôll be uploading exercises to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of algorithms, and explore different techniques.

üìÇ Structure of the Repository
	‚Ä¢	Each folder contains exercises grouped by topics or categories (e.g., sorting algorithms, graph traversal, dynamic programming, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Exercises are written in TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	TypeScript: The primary language for implementing the algorithms.
	‚Ä¢	Node.js: To execute the scripts locally.
	‚Ä¢	Testing Framework (optional): Tests for validating the implementations might be included using frameworks like Jest.

üöÄ How to Use
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-practice.git


	2.	Navigate to the folder:

cd algorithm-practice


	3.	Install dependencies (if applicable):

npm install


	4.	Run an example:

npx ts-node path/to/example.ts



‚ú® Goals
	‚Ä¢	Gain deeper insights into core algorithmic concepts.
	‚Ä¢	Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
	‚Ä¢	Experiment with different problem-solving strategies.

Feel free to fork the repository, contribute, or suggest improvements!
